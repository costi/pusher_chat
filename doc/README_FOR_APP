Chat with pusherapp and websockets
=====

This is an rails 2.2 chat app using websockets made ar ruby hack night 
at enova financial on 8 july 2010. Thanks for providing the space, beer and pizza!
Thanks to Fred and Neal who worked with me at the same time. We all got a working
app at the same time which was pretty cool. Pairing on separate computers :)

It uses pusherapp and the pusher gem to broadcast messages, so no AJAX polling!

How to use
=====

Make an account at pusherapp.com
Rename and edit config/my_pusher_config.rb.example
Install the missing gems (rake gems:install should work).
